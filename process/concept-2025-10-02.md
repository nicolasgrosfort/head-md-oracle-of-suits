## Research

My research began with studying **card manufacturing and the role that cheating played** in their evolution. I explored the gestures, objects and techniques related to cheating practices, until discovering the story of Bianco and his 19th-century scam. By observing the complexity of these mechanics, I identified a paradox: integrating cheating into a game removes its transgressive character. This observation led me to focus on a simple and powerful element, the "shiner" mirror ‚Äî repurposed not to cheat, but to detect cheating. From there, I opened up to card collection as a narrative engine, in order to showcase the richness and diversity of cards throughout history, geography and time *(with emphasis on visual diversity and cultural variations by country)*.

### Insights

1. **Parallel Evolution**

    Cheating and card manufacturing evolved together: each technical innovation came to address flaws exploited by cheaters.

2. **Anatomy of Cheating**

    Cheating combines gestures, techniques, objects and social complicity, making it difficult material to exploit as such in a game.

3. **Revealing the Invisible**

    The "shiner" mirror struck me with the simplicity and power of the gesture it implies: revealing the invisible.

4. **Industrial Scam**

    Bianco's scam in Havana in the 19th century illustrates how simple markings could generate a colossal fraud.
    > In the mid-19th century, Spanish con man Bianco meticulously marked an entire stock of Spanish cards, resealed them in their original packaging and shipped them to Havana where they were sold at fire-sale prices to distributors. Once there, he infiltrated upscale gambling clubs and won fortunes thanks to his pre-marked cards, while publicly complaining about his "losses" to avoid suspicion. The scam only collapsed when another French cheater, Laforcade, discovered the scheme and blackmailed him to share the profits.

5. **Cards of the World**

    Collection as narrative engine: to give shape to the game, I chose to rely on the richness and diversity of cards, present in many cultures and eras.

## Shiner

Shiner is an interactive installation that immerses the player in 19th-century Havana, shaken by a vast rigged card scam. Armed with a cheating mirror, they must reveal invisible marks to identify falsified decks. By inserting cards into the machine, players travel from casino to casino, each card shaping the universe of the game while they attempt to expose the fraud and protect their reputation.
