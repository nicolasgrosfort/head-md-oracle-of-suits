## Research

My research explores how cheating shaped the evolution of playing cards â€” technically, materially, and culturally. Each manufacturing innovation emerged in response to new forms of deception.

I first studied cheating tools and gestures, from marked decks to mirrors (shiners), observing how the body, the gaze, and complicity formed a complete cheating system. The story of Biancoâ€™s 19th-century scam in Havana revealed the scale such practices could reach: a fraud built on invisible marks and human trust.

Initially, I focused on the mirror as a poetic and investigative interface, but early prototypes showed its limits. The reflection was secondary â€” what truly mattered was the act of inspection itself. This led me to shift the interaction from reflection to contact: the card became the controller, merging tactile intuition and technical revelation.

My current work investigates how this tension â€” between hand and machine, intuition and verification â€” can become a playable experience.

### Insights

1. **Parallel Evolution**

    Cheating and card manufacturing evolved together: each technical innovation came to address flaws exploited by cheaters.

2. **Different types of card marking**

    Card marking takes many forms â€” blisters, tinting, shading, or subtle cuts â€” each technique revealing how cheaters learned to manipulate the material limits of paper and ink.

3. **Industrial Scam**

    Bianco's scam in Havana in the 19th century illustrates how simple markings could generate a colossal fraud.

    > In the mid-19th century, Spanish con man Bianco meticulously marked an entire stock of Spanish cards, resealed them in their original packaging and shipped them to Havana where they were sold at fire-sale prices to distributors. Once there, he infiltrated upscale gambling clubs and won fortunes thanks to his pre-marked cards, while publicly complaining about his "losses" to avoid suspicion. The scam only collapsed when another French cheater, Laforcade, discovered the scheme and blackmailed him to share the profits.

4. **Gadget Shiner**

    Although conceptually evocative, the mirror proved to be a poor simulation â€” a false affordance that produced more spectacle than sense. Its gesture felt detached from the logic of cheating, turning the device into a narrative gadget rather than an investigative tool.

5. **The card as an interface**

    The card itself becomes the controller, merging tactile intuition and technical revelation.

## Entropy of Trust

The *Entropy of Trust* is an interactive installation where players investigate real cards, some genuine, some forged.
By sliding them into a table-scanner, they explore their material and visual layers, alternating between tactile intuition and digital revelation. Each decision, cheated or authentic, impacts their reputation in Biancoâ€™s Havana, where truth and illusion intertwine.

Tactility

## Storyboard

 1. **Start**
    The player approaches the table-scanner, a mysterious hybrid between a casino counter and a scientific instrument.
    `Curiosity`

 2. **Brief**
    A short narration recalls the Havana scandal. The player becomes an inspector of illusions, tasked with identifying falsified cards.
    `Engagement`

 3. **Selection**
    Several cards are laid out. Each one holds a story, a different casino, a different atmosphere. The player picks one to investigate.
    `Anticipation`

 4. **Insertion**
    The card slides into the scanning slot. The playerâ€™s hands enter the box, guided by touch and light.
    `Tension`

 5. **Inspection**
    The player manipulates the card â€” feeling, tilting, rubbing. On the screen, a magnified version appears, revealing hidden patterns, tints, or marks.
    `Discovery`

 6. **Revelation**
    Some traces respond to movement, others to light. The player alternates between physical gesture and observation.
    `Suspense`

 7. **Decision**
    When confident, the player removes the card and places it in one of two trays: Cheated or Clean.
    The gesture of placement itself acts as validation.
    `Confidence â€“ Doubt`

 8. **Result**
    The system reveals the truth:
    - Correct â†’ reputation rises.
    - Wrong â†’ trust falters.
    Sound and light punctuate the moment.
    `Pride â€“ Frustration`

 9. **Progression**
    The next card begins another story, another casino. Over time, the player senses patterns, learns to read deceit.
    `Learning`

 10. **Closure**
    The game ends when reputation runs out or the full set is investigated.
    The player leaves having learned the language of cheating.
    `Accomplishment`
