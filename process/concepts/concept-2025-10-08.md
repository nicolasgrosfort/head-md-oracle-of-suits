# Cartridge

 A playful installation where visitors receive a unique card at the museum entrance and insert it like a retro game cartridge. Each card unlocks a bespoke mini‑game — inspired by anecdotes, cheats and hidden histories of playing cards — that uses the body as controller and reveals the cards’ visual and cultural “underside.” Collective in space but personal in play, the card becomes both key and souvenir.

## Research

Our starting point was cheating. Initially imagined as a narrative element, it quickly became a game mechanic, transforming the card into a controller. We then positioned ourselves as cheat inspectors, exploring the back-and-forth relationship between body and machine, on the border between control and play.

To align with the museum’s brief, which invites us to tell the history of playing cards, we sought to connect a variety of anecdotes, historical facts, and fun facts, while highlighting the visual richness of these objects. The anecdote became a way to reveal the hidden side of the cards — their “underside.”

We then imagined that each card contains a mini-game, inspired by the anecdote linked to it. After exploring the round table as a space for physically navigating through the cards, we conceived a dispenser placed at the entrance of the exhibition, offering each visitor a unique card.

Inserted into the installation like a retro game cartridge, this card grants access to a specific mini-game, creating an experience that is both collective and individual.
