Classic card games bore me a little. I often find it hard to get into a card game because the rules aren’t visual or simple. You can’t just _understand how it works by trying_. You’re forced to _intellectualize the rules_ in order to play. #rule

Throwing cards, on the other hand, is super accessible. Almost anyone can do it (my 96-year-old grandmother still can — though I know that’s an exception). #throwing 

I’m fascinated by the excitement that can come from simply drawing a card at _random_. That’s such a fun part of playing cards. It even feels like they were designed for that — after all, they all have a hidden side. #random

It’s important to me to be able to understand a game’s rules _through playing_. The learning curve should be very small. The _gesture_, engaging the _body_, seems to me like a good way to learn — and that’s what I want to explore.

Could everyday gestures or games — playing with the _form_ of the card rather than its symbolic meaning — be a way to enter the world of playing cards?

I also find it interesting to explore _hacking_ — or rather, _appropriation_. For example, _inventing your own game_ using an existing deck of cards. #hacking

I’m interested in orienting my research toward the history of Nintendo, which started by making playing cards, then physical games, and later electronic games.

The playing card could be seen as an _interface_ — as a kind of _game console_ ?
