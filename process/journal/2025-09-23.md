What kind of relationship do children have with playing cards?
What _is_ a card for a child?
Which gestures are difficult for them to perform?
How does the museum make sure children understand the rules?

Those are my morning questions.

I have to choose one research focus among the six main domains:

1. **Families of suits** 
2. **Historical references**
3. **Court cards**
4. **Special cards**
5. **Geographical circulation**
6. **Card manufacturing**

I‚Äôm most interested in three areas, in order of preference:

- **Card manufacturing**: techniques, materials, constraints, innovations, evolving gestures and manipulations, the link with cheating, and the card as a technical artifact. This resonates with my broader interest in _objects_ in this master‚Äôs program.
- **Special cards**: the visual and narrative freedom they offer.
- **Families of suits**: game systems, logic, mechanics‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm choosing to narrow my research to the manufacturing of **Hanafuda** cards by Nintendo.

This choice is linked to my recent trip to Japan, which left a strong impression on me, and to the fascinating connection (or _transition_) between these cards and video games. There‚Äôs also a connection with Pok√©mon and the idea of _collecting/searching_, which speaks to me. #nintendo

What distinguishes a deck of cards from a game console?
What links exist between them?

A playing card can also be seen as an interface ‚Äî a way to access multiple games, just like inserting a cartridge into a console. #cartidge
