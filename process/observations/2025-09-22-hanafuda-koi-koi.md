## Journal

[[process/references/hanafuda|hanafuda]] is the **Japanese equivalent of our playing cards** — so it can also be played with different sets of rules. **Koï-Koï** is the most popular game played with Hanafuda cards. #hanafuda #koi-koi

The game originated from **Portuguese playing cards**, which were **re-appropriated by the Japanese in the 16th century**.

**Nintendo** roughly means _“leave luck to heaven”_ (interpretation). #fun-fact #nintendo

Each card seems to carry a **strong cultural imprint**. For example, one card illustrates the story of the **wise man who brings the rabbit to the moon** — a reference to the **moon rabbit** in Japanese folklore. #visual
