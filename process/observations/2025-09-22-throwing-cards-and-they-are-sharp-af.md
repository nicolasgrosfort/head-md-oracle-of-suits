# Throwing cards and they are sharp af

## Journal

The person seems to have either bought or made **throwing cards**. You can see they have **reinforced edges**. It reminds me a bit of [[process/references/hanafuda|hanafuda]] cards. #hanafuda

The act of **throwing** is interesting in the sense that it’s common to all types of cards — it’s playful and accessible. 

However, it has no connection to suits, colors, or families… In that sense, it isn’t really relevant for the project ?  #throwing
