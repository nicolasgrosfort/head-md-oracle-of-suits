# Booster pack

A **booster pack** (or simply _booster_) is a **small sealed pack** containing a limited number of cards (usually 5 to 15). #sealed 

The cards inside are **random**, with a distribution designed by the publisher (common, uncommon, rare, special cards, etc.).

The idea is simple: **buying a booster** _“boosts”_ your collection by adding **new surprise cards**. #surprise

It’s the card game equivalent of **blind packs** found in other worlds — like figurines, toys, or **gashapon** in Japan.
