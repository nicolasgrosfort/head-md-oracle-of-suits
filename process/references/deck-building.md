# Deck Building

Example of a game: **Dominion**. #dominion

The principle is to **build your own deck of cards** and play with it â€” a bit like _Magic: The Gathering_. #magic-gathering

The rules are shared, but the **cards themselves are different**, which creates variety in how each game is played.
