# Hanafuda

Hanafuda (花札, “flower cards”) is a family of Japanese card games using a 48-card deck, divided into 12 suits of 4 cards each. #hanafuda

Each suit represents a month of the year and is associated with a specific flower or plant (e.g., pine in January, cherry blossom in March, maple in October, etc.). #season #suit

Like most card games, it’s a mix of chance and strategy — at least, that’s the idea.
